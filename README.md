### Ladle ðŸ¥£
A color picker.

This is a simple color picker web application for everyone to use.
**No accounts, no labels, only ladles.**


 *It will probably be available on my site http://eazyizzie.dev in the future.* 

It's being set-up at the moment and I'm working on creating an API from scratch in Go to be used on back-end. In front-end HTML and CSS will do the job.  *Not doing this on Figma yet*  (:
