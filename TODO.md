    -a. **!** Figure out how to convert colors and have the ability to convert them from the color spectrum to each type (hex,rgb,hsl,hsv) available to the end user.
    -b. *READ THE ABOVE AGAIN.*
    ❌- Create the index page, and check error page implementation in the site you want add this.
    ❌- Determine the CSS style and implement it in the page.
    ❌- Check what is needed in order for the index.html to work with the site.
     - Update people that might care on the existence of the web app and where they can find it.

❕*Update @ 02/09/2025 15:25*
       - Not possible to add it to the site. It seems it the platform I'm using doesn't allow web apps at the moment. So even I've set it up as a page, it would not be possible. In search of alternatives. Keeping the API posibility just for education purposes & possible remake as a web app hosted on localhost.
